        <h3>Goobers Adventure (UNFINISHED)</h3>
        <p>Goobers Adventure was a project I started on when I was first learning how to code.  It was developed in Unity using C#, and I really enjoyed working on it.  It follows the story of a slime character, or was supposed to, in reality it was just me experimenting with sprites, animations, and different gameplay elements I wanted to try and code.</p>
